            <div class="intro">
                Last year I started a fry account on instagram, documenting fries. The information I’ve documented through this collection could be helpful for finding restaurants with good fries. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>For my data points, I compiled:</li>
                <li>- The photo of each item </li>
                <li>- Restaurant it is from</li>
                <li>- Photo of the fries</li>
                <li>- Temperature level</li>
                <li>- Date of consumption </li>
                <li>- Rating</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><video width="1000" height="600" controls>
                <source src="screenrec.mov" type=video/mp4>
            </video></p>
                
            <div class="fonts">
                <p>I used Kaeru Kaeru for the title font and Hanken Grotesk for the body text</p>
                <p><img src="./kaeru.png" alt="Kaeru" width="50%"></p>
                <p><img src="./hanken.png" alt="Hanken" width="50%"></p>
                <p>I picked the Kaeru Kaeru font because it reminded me of what it would look like if you used ketchup splatter to write out a message. And the Hanken Grotesk font was a good pick for the body text as it was a clean san serif, easy to read, and reminded me of a font you would see used on a menu.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="mobile">
                <p>For the mobile view, I had it be two columns instead of 4, and when making the site, used primarily viewport width and height values so it was more responsive to begin with</p>

            </div>


            <div class="struggle">
                <p>When making my site, I had a bit of a hard time establishing the grid/ getting it to load properly, but eventually I figured it out and managed to make it work. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                I also was trying to establish a boolean toggle button in the site where you could click it and it would show what fries were crispy and which were not, but I was having a really hard time making it work
                <br>
                <br>
                If I had more time / more skills with javascript, I would have liked to make the page more interactive, clicking on each photo would bring up a popup menu with more information or the data points, but overall I’m pleased with how it came out

        I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to
        talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, <em>but it begins off the page,</em> it begins in
        the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem
        gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of <a
            href="part-three/index.html">ice</a>, <em>and it's your house.</em>

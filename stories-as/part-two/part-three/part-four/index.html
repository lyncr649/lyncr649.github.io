        Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a
        line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is
        always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you
        have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a
        cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.

        I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they
        will get the wrong idea.

        Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when
        everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the
        Esimo for <a href="part-five/index.html">snow</a>. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some
        languages are so constructed—English among them—that <em>we each only really speak one sentence in our
        lifetime.</em> That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your
        last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on
        hand. Or, if you are blessed, <em>they are heard by someone who</em> knows you and loves you and <em>will be
        sorry to hear the sentence end.</em>

    <h1>On Beginnings</h1>
    <h2>From Madness, Rack and Honey by Mary Ruefle</h2>

    <p>
        In life, the number of beginnings is <em>exactly equal</em> to the number of endings: <em>no one has yet to
            begin a life who will not end it.</em>

        In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. Not
        every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be
        an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.

        Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely
        abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.

        Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have
        never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a <a
            href="part-two/index.html">fruit</a> on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and
        the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.

        In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of
        thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that <em>nothing can precede action</em>—no breath
        before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.
